# íº‘ Self-Healing AWS Infrastructure (ECS + CloudWatch + Lambda)

## í³Œ Overview

This project demonstrates a **self-healing cloud infrastructure** built on AWS that can automatically detect application failures and remediate them **without human intervention**.

The system monitors a containerized application running on **ECS Fargate** using **CloudWatch alarms**. When a failure or performance issue is detected, an **AWS Lambda function** is triggered to take corrective action such as restarting tasks or scaling the service. Human-readable alerts are sent via **SNS** so engineers stay informed.

This project was built to simulate **real-world production incidents** and showcase practical DevOps and SRE skills at a junior-to-mid level.

---

## í¾¯ Problem Statement

Modern cloud applications frequently experience issues such as:

* Application crashes
* Memory leaks
* CPU exhaustion
* Bad deployments causing 5XX errors

In many teams, these issues are still handled **manually**, leading to:

* Slow incident response
* Downtime
* On-call fatigue

**Goal:** Build a system that detects these issues early and automatically fixes them while notifying engineers.

## í´¥ Breakable Application

The application is intentionally designed to fail in realistic ways.

### Endpoints

| Endpoint       | Description        | Purpose               |
| -------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- |
| `/`            | Health check       | ALB health checks     |
| `/crash`       | Terminates process | Simulates app crash   |
| `/memory-leak` | Consumes memory    | Triggers memory alarm |
| `/cpu-spike`   | Burns CPU          | Triggers CPU alarm    |
| `/slow`        | Delayed response   | Simulates latency     |

---

## â° Monitoring & Alarms

CloudWatch alarms are configured with **production-safe thresholds**:

| Alarm           | Threshold       | Action              |
| --------------- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| High Memory     | >75% for 2 min  | Restrt ECS tasks   |
| High CPU        | >80% for 3 min  | Scae service       |
| ALB 5XX Errors  | â‰¥5 errors/min   | Restt taskalars       |
| Unhealthy Tasks | < desired count | Alert + remediation |

All alarms publish events to **EventBridge**, which triggers Lambda.

---

## ï¿½ï¿½ Lambda Auto-Remediation Logic

The Lambda function acts as the **decision engine**.

### Behavior

* Parses CloudWatch alarm events
* Applies deterministic remediation rules
* Executes ECS actions
* Sends contextual SNS alerts

### Example Rules

* Memory leak â†’ Restart ECS tasks
* CPU pressure â†’ Scale servce up
* 5XX errors â†’ Restart tasks

Guardrails are implemeted to prevent:

* Infnite reinistarts
* Runaway scalg

---

## í³£ Notficationinis

Engineers receive alerts such as:

```
íº¨ Alarm Triggered: ecs-high-memory-self-healing
í»  Action Taken: Restarted ECS tasks
í³¦ Cluster: self-healing-cluster
í³¡ Service: breakable-app-service
```

This ensures **visibility without manual intervention**.

---

## í·ª Failure Scenarios ested

* ManuTal crash via `/crash`
* Memory leak via `/memory-leak`
* CPU spike via `/cpu-spike`
* Application returning 5XX errors

Each scenario successfully triggered alarms and automatic recovery.

---

## í´ Security & Best Practices

* IAM roles follow **least privilege**
* No hardcoded credentials
* Configuration via environment variables
* Guardrails on scaling actions

---

## í²° Cost Awareness

* Fargate used to avoid idle EC2 costs
* Conservative alarmthreholds
* Slimits enforced in Lmbd saling aca

This project is designed to be **low-cost** while demonstrating production patterns.
